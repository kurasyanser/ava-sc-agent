1. Project Overview
We’re building a Smart Contract Security Monitor. It will check smart contracts on the Avalanche blockchain for bugs and security risks. The goal is to help developers and users catch problems early, making the ecosystem safer.

2. Core Features
Contract Scanning

It will automatically scan contracts for common problems like reentrancy attacks or overflow issues.

Both static (before running) and dynamic (while running) checks will be included.

Real-time Alerts

The system will keep an eye on live contracts and flag anything unusual.

You’ll get alerts for suspicious activity or weird patterns.

Risk Reports

Each contract gets a report with the issues found and tips to fix them.

A simple risk score shows how safe a contract is at a glance.

Integration and Alerts

It will work with popular tools like MetaMask and IDEs.

Notifications can come through email or apps like Slack.

3. System Requirements
Fast Performance:

The tool should scan contracts quickly (under 10 seconds).

Real-time alerts should be nearly instant.

Security:

Data will be secure and encrypted.

Scalability:

It should handle lots of contracts as the network grows.

Compatibility:

It will work with Solidity contracts and run smoothly on major browsers.

4. Development Steps
Step 1: Research (3 weeks)

Find out which security issues are most common.

Plan the system layout.

Step 2: Build a Prototype (8 weeks)

Backend: Create the scanner and monitoring system.

ML Model: Train a model to spot strange behavior.

Step 3: UI Development (5 weeks)

Make a web interface where users can upload contracts and see results.

Set up alerts and notifications.

Step 4: Testing (4 weeks)

Run tests to make sure it catches real problems.

Speed up any slow parts.

Step 5: Launch (2 weeks)

Put the system online and ready to use.

Keep an eye out for bugs and fix them fast.

5. Team Needed
Backend Developer (1 person)

Build the scanner and connect it to the blockchain.

ML Engineer (1 person)

Create the anomaly detection model.

Frontend Developer (1 person)

Develop the user interface.

Security Analyst (1 person)

Help define what to check for and validate the findings.

Project Manager (1 person)

Keep the project on track and on time.

UI/UX Designer (Optional, 1 person)

Design a simple, clean interface.

6. Timeline
Total Time: About 22 weeks (5.5 months).

Breakdown:

Research: 3 weeks

Prototype: 8 weeks

UI Development: 5 weeks

Testing: 4 weeks

Launch: 2 weeks

7. Cost Estimate
Team Salaries: $60,000–$80,000 for 5.5 months.

Infrastructure: $3,000–$6,000 for servers and tools.

Other Costs: $2,000 for unexpected expenses.

8. Success Criteria
It should find over 90% of bugs in tested contracts.

Alerts should pop up in less than 5 seconds.

The interface should be easy to use.

It should work well with popular tools.
